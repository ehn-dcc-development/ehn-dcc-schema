The image files 'dgc_qr_generate.png' and 'dgc_qr_verify.png' are not directly used by the FAQ.
However, they've obviously been used to produce 'dcc_postels_law_issuance.png', resp., 'dcc_postels_law_verification.png'.
The former two files are kept in the interest of being able to reproduce the latter two files at sufficient resolution, and because a source to attribute to wasn't found.
